Explanation:

1. **Document Metadata:** Meta tags provide information about the HTML document. The `charset` specifies the character encoding, and the `viewport` sets the initial scale for responsive design.

2. **Bootstrap CSS Link:** The `<link>` tag is used to include the Bootstrap CSS file, which provides styling for the document.

3. **Title:** The title of the document is changed to "Code Snippets."

4. **Container:** The `container` class from Bootstrap is applied to create a container with a top margin of 3 units.

5. **Headings and Paragraphs:** Descriptive headings and paragraphs explain the purpose of the document and provide examples of inline code usage.

6. **Inline Code:** The `<code>` tags are used to represent inline code within the paragraphs.

This code is now commented and translated into English, making it more readable and understandable.
